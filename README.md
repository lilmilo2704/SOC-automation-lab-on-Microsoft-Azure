# 🛡️ SOC Automation Lab on Microsoft Azure

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Security Operations Center (SOC) automation lab** deployed on **Microsoft Azure**, focusing on automated detection, enrichment, incident management, and response.

The lab integrates:
- **Wazuh** as the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform  
- **TheHive** for incident response and case management  
- **Shuffle** as the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform  
- **VirusTotal** for threat intelligence enrichment  

The environment is designed using a **two–virtual machine Azure architecture**, separating SIEM operations from incident response services. Security telemetry is generated from a **Windows 11 endpoint**, and attack simulation is performed using **Mimikatz** to validate end-to-end detection and response workflows.
